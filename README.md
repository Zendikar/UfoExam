# Copyright Infringement

Code is being patented by companies. Startup companies/entrepreneurs have struggle writing code which doesn't involve using copyrighted code. Checking through patented code is possible with some sort of algorithm checking through patented code. Checking that your code isn’t caught by patents or using open source code prevents other companies trying to take part of your revenue.

An example of how patent shows in software development/computer science study is the importance of not taking others code without at least referring to where you get the code in case you choose to do so. Also a specific amount of the code should show that the student has done some decent amount of work behind the code. Some students may think that they can put in some white spaces and move som code around and maybe change some comments to simulate that the code is their own. But a program fx MOSS made to detect and compare source codes from relevant websites such as fx github and stackoverflow can do a lot of magic here. It can compare source code automatically with a search but since it's an AI it can easily miss a “human touch”, so you should not use the algorithm as a final judgement, but rather as a sign that the student might have cheated. Understanding the algorithm as a student might be beneficial to cheat the system, but since the amount of work behind to rewrite the code so it is hard to detect it has been taken from another place. Also it takes the same amount of time to write the code yourself, so it doesn’t make sense to rewrite code taken as you also might miss out on a learning possibility. Also rewriting code may be possible to be done by a complex AI using deep learning where the AI stores data simulating the rural networks in our brains. This method might not be fine tuned yet, but it is a consideration in the future as more complex AI and algorithms will be developed. But at that point most simple code might not be needed to be written by human and maybe a focus on other things might arise.
To come back on track this can be translated into the businesses as well besides computer science related studies, as you might get sued if you take code from copyrighted sources. This mostly come to relevance because of the United States’ copyright laws, where they have a legal system where you can copyright your code and if others copy it you have the right to sue others. This is a problem due to people might try sue others based on small parts that are the same, and if you own a small company you might not be able to afford a lawsuit. So a good idea is to check if your code doesn’t contain copyrighted code, and claim your code after so others don’t. Or if you use others code make sure it is open source. Checking if your code is copyrighted might cost money though and so does a request, but it might be worth it after all.
Making such a program that can compare code from data mining websites like we learned from business intelligence.
